This runs in [Processing](https://processing.org/) (version 3 at the time this
is being written) and requires the
[Minim](http://code.compartmental.net/tools/minim/) audio library. To install
Minim, in Processing's menu open `Sketch -> Import Library... -> Add Library...`,
search for Minim and hit the Install button.

Of course, running this as intended will also require the instrument files
referenced in the code, but they're not provided here. However, you can remove
references to them and play around without them (an exercise left to the
reader).

Most of the code here is extremely ad-hoc & unclear, and I probably won't build
on it directly, but I'm leaving it here for those who may be curious. It looks
like this when running (a lot is lost when not in motion, of course).
